# Niels Segers

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Niels and I'm a passionate full stack developer from Belgium with a keen interest in both frontend and backend technologies.

I mostly work with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://react.dev/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) but also take the time to explore other languages like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Golang](https://go.dev/) to create CLI tools that add value to projects.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me listening to music or building custom keyboards.
